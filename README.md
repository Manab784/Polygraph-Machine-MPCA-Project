# Polygraph-Machine-MPCA-Project
A Polygraph Machine (Lie Detector) built on Arduino.

In this project, weâ€™ll try to get some information from human body using simple sensors and Arduino, and detect if the phrases spoken out by the person are true or false. 

### Key Takeaways
- Know polygraph and basics of measuring and recording physiological indicators.
- Will be familiar with lie detector systems.
- Can get data from sensors and analyze them by Arduino.
- Can measure respiration rate by using ECG electrodes and impedance pneumography.

### Components Required
- Arduino Uno R3
- Heart Rate Pulse Sensor Module
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Male to Female Jumper Wires
